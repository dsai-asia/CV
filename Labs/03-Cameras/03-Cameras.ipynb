    "## Camera Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera system is an important module in any machine vision system. The camera sytem integrates with an overall machine vision system as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-1.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The important parameters in a camera system are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Resolution: size of relevant aspect of object of interest.\n",
    " 2. Field of View (FOV): The area the camera captures. HFOV and VFOV indicate the horizontal and vertical FOVs.\n",
    " 3. Working Distance (WD): Distance between the camera and object. Fixed in an industrial system or variable in other applications.\n",
    " 4. Sensor Size: Size of the CCD or CMOS image sensor chip on the digital camera's circuit board.\n",
    " 5. Depth of Field (DOF): Distance between the nearest and farthest objects that are in focus.\n",
    " 6. Image Resolution: Size of image, $(w \\times h)$. Standard sizes such as 1920$\\times$1080 HD are referred to by the vertical resolution,\n",
    "    e.g. 1080p.\n",
    " 7. Pixel: Grayscale, RGB, multispectral, etc. For a fixed working distance, a pixel's backprojection has a fixed size, e.g., 2 mm per pixel.\n",
    " 8. Object Resolution: size of object of interest when imaged at the minimum size (e.g., faces at 20$\\times$20 or\n",
    "    humans at 64$\\times$128).\n",
    " 9. Focal Length: Distance between the image plane and the optical center of the camera, measured in pixels or mm.\n",
    " 10. Magnification: Ratio between sensor size and FOV.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-2.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",

    "### Image Sensors\n",
    " \n",
    "When an image is captured by the image sensor, the state of each photoreceptor\n",
    "is saved then transferred to host memory. Image sensors in digital cameras and\n",
    "industrial sensors may be one of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    " - CCDs convert photoreceptor charges to analog voltages then digitized off-chip\n",
    " - CMOS sensors have separate digitization circuitry for every pixel\n",
    "\n",
    "Early fabrication techniques in the 1970s and 1980s were more suitable for CCDs, so available CCD sensors delivered much higher quality images and therefore\n",
    "dominated machine vision. In the 1990s, mobile phone commoditization started pushing CMOS technology, and now the available CMOS sensors are equal to or greater\n",
    "than CCDs in quality and much cheaper, though CCDs still deliver higher quality NIR imaging than CMOS sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image sensor size is the main way to adjust the quality of the image output. Early on, most sensors had 4:3 aspect ratios, but now HD resolutions with 16:9\n",
    "ratios are becoming more common.\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-4.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the size and density of the photoreceptors on the image sensor, we get different image resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-5.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to know if resolution is suitable for your work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The International Standards Organization has standard 12233, which\n",
    "defines various standardized charts that can be used to assess the\n",
    "quality of an image. Here is the \"legacy\" (pre-2000) chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-6.jpg\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can purchase charts from the ISO or print one yourself. See\n",
    "[Stephen Westin's Cornell Graphics web page on the ISO resolution chart](https://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~westin/misc/res-chart.html)\n",
    "for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rough idea can be obtained by considering the physical size of the smallest detail you want to analyze, considering how accurately\n",
    "you want to analyze it (the minimum number of pixels that should span the detail), then using that to calculate the necessary image\n",
    "resolution, lens focal length, and working distance. For example, suppose\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want to detect cracks in a surface object that are a minimum 0.5. mm wide.\n",
    "2. You believe your crack detection algorithm requires at least 4 pixels of width\n",
    "   to ensure accurate detection (8 pixels per mm).\n",
    "3. You like the image quality and price of a 2 MP HD camera with a 50 degree HFOV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since object size in pixels is $fX/Z$, we can write $$4 \\text{pixels} = f \\text{pixels} \\times 0.5 \\text{mm} / D.$$\n",
    "To get $f$, we know that $$\\tan^{-1}(25^\\circ) = 960 / f,$$ so $f = 2333.3$ and $D = 0.2916$ m. If a 29 cm working distance\n",
    "is OK for our application, the last step would be to ensure that the camera can focus on objects at that distance and make sure\n",
    "the DOF around a focus of 29 cm is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frame rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Another parameter that is important in most applications is the camera's frame rate. It is measured in frames per second.\n",
    "When you are imaging objects in motion, you should consider the maximum object velocity at the minimum working distance. That\n",
    "will tell you the maximum object displacement to expect per frame. For object tracking, you would want to ensure a fast enough\n",
    "frame rate that successive images of the moving object overlap sufficiently to have high confidence when associating the object\n",
    "appearance in a new frame with the object's appearance in the previous frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three other factors are related to frame rate: exposure time, shutter type, and interlacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A short exposure time will minimize motion blur but will also decrease contrast. A longer exposure time will allow more light\n",
    "to reach the sensor, improving contrast but also increasing motion blur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shutter can be global (CCD sensors and some CMOS sensors) or rolling (most CMOS sensors). A global shutter captures the entire\n",
    "image simultaneously, while a rolling shutter exposes sensor elements sequentially. If the shutter is fast enough relative to object motion,\n",
    "the shutter type is unimprotant. But if object motion (or camera motion) is high, a global shutter is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interlacing means that multiple passes are required to piece together the image. For example, even-numbered rows may be imaged on the\n",
    "first pass and odd-numbered rows may be imaged on the second pass. Interlacing is not common on modern sensors.\n"

    "## Understanding Lens Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Lens specifications have two important measurements: Focal Length and Aperture (F-Stop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aperture (F-Stop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aperture (called \"F-Stop\" in commercial camera specifications)\n",
    "indicates the width of the opening allowing light into the lens.\n",
    "Aperture (A) is measured relative to focal length:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\frac{f}{S},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the \"aperture scale.\" Smaller aperture scales mean more light than\n",
    "larger aperture scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-7.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "When illumination is low, you may need larger apertures (smaller aperture scale numbers):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-9.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "And conversely, when light is especially bright,\n",
    "you may need smaller apertures. Aperture has interesting effects\n",
    "on especially bright light sources like the sun:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-8.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But more importantly, when you have good illumination, you can afford to reduce the aperture\n",
    "(increase the aperture number), which has the benefit of giving you a larger DOF:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-10.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, you would like to have a large DOF for a mobile robot, so you might want a very small\n",
    "aperture, but on the other hand, you also want a wide field of view (shorter focal length),\n",
    "which reduces your relative aperture size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focal length\n",
    "\n",
    "Focal length is the distance between the image sensor and the center of projection. In camera\n",
    "specifications, it is measured in mm, whereas in machine vision calculations, it is measured in pixels.\n",
    "Longer focal lengths give more zoom and smaller FOV.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-11.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A small focal length is great for imaging a wide field of view, but spreading the image out so much\n",
    "also typically requires a more convex lens, which increases the radial distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-12.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab04-13.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planar Perspective Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "When your camera's principal axis is not orthogonal to the surface you're imaging, you will experience perspective distortion. As\n",
    "we've seen in class, if the object is truly planar, we can correct the image using a 4-point homography.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radial Distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"distortion\" might be used to describe any kind of warping of an object due to depth, non-orthogonal principal axis, or\n",
    "\"bending\" of straight lines. In computer vision, we normally reserve the word \"distortion\" to refer to non-pinhole effects arising\n",
    "from the use of a lens to achieve the desired projection onto the image sensor. Non-pinhole distortion is either *radial* (warping\n",
    "along a vector emanting from a center of distortion), which is very common, especially with wide angle lenses, and *tangential*\n",
    "(warping orthogonal to the radial direction), which is less common and normally arises due to imprecise lens mounting. Getting precise\n",
    "measurements from a camera system requires either taking distortion into account or eliminating it. Distortion\n",
    "can be eliminated using optical techniques (using compound lenses and other hardware techniques), but this is expensive and possibly bulky.\n",
    "A more practical solution to eliminate distortion is to model the distortion function of your camera system then either use that model\n",
    "in your calculations or rectify every image before further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling process is called *spatial calibration* and uses a known calibration pattern:\n",

Given the intrinsic, distortion, rotation and translation matrices, we must first transform the object point to image point using cv.projectPoints(). Then, we can calculate the absolute norm between what we got with our transformation and the corner finding algorithm.
