    "The first discrimination we should make is the difference between stereo (or indeed any multiview) and 3D reconstruction using calibrated rigs and SfM. A rig of two or more cameras assumes that we already know the motion between the cameras, while in SfM, we don't know what the motion is, and we need to find it. Calibrated rigs, from a simplistic point of view, allow a much more accurate reconstruction of 3D geometry because there is no error in estimating the distances and rotations between the cameras, which are already known. The first step in SfM, on the other hand, is finding the motion between the cameras.\n",

    "In most cases, we wish to obtain the geometry of the scene, for example, where objects are in relation to the cameras and what their form is. Having found the motion between the cameras picturing the same scene, we would then like to reconstruct the geometry, initially in the form of a point cloud by triangulation. Conceptualy, the rays through a camera's optical center and a point in the idealized image plane for different 2D projections of the same 3D point will intersect at the correct 3D point in the real world that is imaged in each camera. In practice, however, with noise in the correspondence, the two rays will not strictly intersect, and we will have to minimize some cost function to find the 3D point minimizing that cost. The situation is shown in the following diagram.\n",

The essential matrix is actually a fundamental matrix for the special case of normalized points with calibrated cameras, and using the essential matrix rather than the fundamental matrix for unnomralized points will give us a metric rather than projective reconstruction of the scene.

    "### Point matching using rich feature descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction and descriptor matching is useful for many computer vision tasks, e.g., detecting the position and orientation of an object in an image or searching a big database of images for similar images given a query image. **Feature extraction** means selecting points in the image that can be uniquely identified in other views of the same scene and computing a descriptor for each of them. A descriptor is just a vector of numbers that describes the texture around a feature point in an image. Different methods give different length and data types for descriptor vectors. **Descriptor matching** is the process of finding a corresponding feature for one set in another using the descriptor. OpenCV provides powerful methods to support feature extraction and matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image sequence, we will obtain three elements: feature points for two images (ORB, AKAZE, SIFT, SURF), descriptors for them, and a matching between the two sets of features (bruteforce).\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCV, the brute-force matcher performs cross-check filtering. A match is considered true if a feature of the first image matches a feature of the second image, and the reverse check also matches the feature of the second image with the feature of the first image. Another common filtering mechanism, used in the provided code, is to filter based on the fact that the two images are of the same scene and have a certain stereo-view relationship between them. In practice, the filter tries to robustly calculate the fundamental or essential matrix which we will learn about in the \"Finding camera matrices\" section and retain those feature pairs that correspond with this calculation with small errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to using rich features, such as ORB, is to use optical flow. It is possible to use optical flow instead of descriptor matching to find the required point matching between two images, while the rest of the SfM pipeline remains the same."

    "There are a number of ways to correctly reconstruct the 3D scene data from multiple views. One way to achieve **camera pose estimation** or **camera resectioning**, is the **Perspective N-Point(PnP)** algorithm, where we try to solve for the position of a new camera using N 3D scene points, which we have already found and their respective 2D image points. Another way is to triangulate more points and see how they fit into our existing scene geometry; this will tell us the position of the new camera by means of **point cloud registration**.

This simple test is a very fundamental concept in many computer vision algorithms that rely on feature matching (such as SfM, panorama stitching, sparse tracking, and more). Instead of looking for a single match for a feature from image A in image B, we look for two matches in image B and make sure there is no confusion. Confusion in matching may arise if two potential matching-feature descriptors are too similar (in terms of their distance metric) and we cannot tell which of them is the correct match for the query, so we discard them both to prevent confusion.\n",

    "### Finding feature tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of feature tracks was introduced in SfM literature as early as 1992 in Tomasi and Kanade's work (Shape and Motion from Image Streams, 1992) and made famous in Snavely and Szeliski's seminal photo tourism work from 2007 for large-scale unconstrained reconstructions. Tracks are simply the 2D positions of a single scene feature, an interesting point, over a number of views. Tracks are important since they maintain consistency across frames than can be composed into a global optimization problem, as Snavely suggested. Tracks are specifically important to us since OpenCV's sfm module allows to reconstruct a scene by providing just the 2D tracks across all the views:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab07-5.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having already found a pair-wise match between all views, we have the required information to find tracks within those matched features. If we follow feature i in the first image to the second image through the match, then from the second image to the third image through their own match, and so on, we would end up with its track. This sort of bookkeeping can easily become too hard to implement in a straightforward fashion with standard data structures. However, it can be simply done if we represent all the matches in a match graph. Each node in the graph would be a feature detected in a single image, and edges would be the matches we recovered. From the feature nodes of the first image, we would have many edges to the feature nodes of the second image, third image, fourth image, and so on (for matches not discarded by our filters). Since our matches are reciprocal (symmetric), the graph can be undirected. Moreover, the reciprocity test ensures that for feature i in the first image, there is only one matching feature j in the second image, and vice versa: feature j will only match back to feature i.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a visual example of such a match graph. The node colors represent the image from which the feature point (node) has originated. Edges represent a match between image features. We can notice the very strong pattern of a feature matching chain from the first image to the last:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lab07-6.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
